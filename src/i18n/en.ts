    bio: `Hello my name is Sonia Diaz and I’ve been working with children for the past 22 years. I’ve worked with organizations like Head Start and OCDC supporting children in early education, always giving myself room to grow professionally.

    After several years of working alongside other professionals and expanding my skills, I was able to obtain my very own license to be an independent provider. I focused on early education servicing mainly babies and toddlers, curating creative curriculums using the Montessori methods. I enjoy implementing activities to the children that will stimulate all 5 senses to encourage a healthy development.`,
    philosophy: `My philosophy is to offer high quality childcare in a fun and safe environment where children have the opportunity to grow intellectually, socially, and emotionally. My approach is offering care, understanding,  and guidance through age appropriate activities. I plan activities with love and care, and help in catering an environment to encourage learning and growth. One of my strengths is my ability to communicate with families the needs that I see in their children when in my care. I strive to support families to meet any goals they may have.

    In addition,  we also invite families to participate in any activities we have planned with their children as we believe and encourage inclusion and diversity within our space.`,
