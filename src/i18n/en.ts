  aboutus: {
    bio: `Hello, my name is Sonia Diaz. I have lived in the United States for 35 years. I have been working for 22 years supporting early childhood education. I have worked for programs such as Head Start and OCDC, supporting children in their educational development, always pursuing professional development.

    I currently work independently, have trained, and have obtained my license to work individually. My educational focus is supporting infants and toddlers, implementing the creative curriculum and Montessori theories.

    I love implementing real-life activities for children, enabling them to develop their five senses by stimulating them with real objects.`,
    philosophy: `My philosophy is to offer high quality childcare in a fun and safe environment whereby children have the opportunity to grow intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically. I achieve these goals by offering affection, understanding, protection, and guidance through age appropriate activities. I plan all these activities with love and care to be catered around an environment that encourages learning and growth. One of my strengths is my ability to communicate with families the needs that I see in their children when in my care, I aim to guide families and their children to meet any goals set out by them.

    We also invite families to participate in any activities we have planned with their children to encourages inclusion and diversity within our space.`,
